# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
## Design Decisions and Trade-offs
### Weather API Service
**Decision:**
- Implemented weatherbit.io API for fetching weather data

**Reasoning:**
- Weatherbit.io offers valuable features in their free trial (historical data, multi-day forecasts)
- Provides resources to customize the user experience
- Well-documented API with straightforward implementation
- Reliable location based data accuracy for weather forecasting

**Trade-offs:**
- Free trial has full access to all functions, but for a limited time 21 days.
- For production use, consider implementing:
    - Paid subscription plan
    - Enhanced caching strategy to reduce API calls

### Local Storage for Caching

**Decision:**
- Used localStorage to cache API results

**Reasoning:**
- Reduces redundant API calls
- Improves app performance
- Conserves API request limits

**Trade-offs:**
- Local storage has size limitations
- Does not support automatic expiration
- Requires additional logic to handle stale data

### Responsive Design with Chakra UI

**Decision:**
- Used Chakra UI for styling and responsiveness

**Reasoning:**
- Provides pre-designed components and theming support
- Speeds up development while maintaining a professional appearance
- Offers built-in responsive design utilities

**Trade-offs:**
- The abstraction limits control over some styling details
- May introduce unnecessary dependencies if only basic styles are required
- Increases initial bundle size

### Browser Geolocation

**Decision:**
- Used browser geolocation to fetch weather data for the user's current location

**Reasoning:**
- Enhances user experience by providing localized weather data automatically

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires user permission
- Failure to grant access could lead to a degraded experience
- May require fallback to manual location input

### Testing Frameworks

**Decision:**
- Adopted Jest and Playwright for testing

**Reasoning:**
- Jest provides reliable unit testing
- Playwright offers powerful end-to-end testing for UI workflows

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires additional time for setting up and maintaining tests

### Focus on Performance

**Decision:**
- Optimized the app to minimize unnecessary API calls and ensure responsiveness

**Reasoning:**
- Enhances user experience, especially in areas with limited bandwidth

**Trade-offs:**
- Increased initial development time to implement optimizations
- Required additional complexity for caching

### Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

**Decision:**
- Implemented GitHub Actions CI workflow to build and test PRs before allowing merges

**Reasoning:**
- Prevents integration of broken code into the main branch
- Ensures all tests pass before code reaches production
- Automates quality checks to maintain codebase standards
- Provides immediate feedback to developers on code quality

**Trade-offs:**
- Adds time to the PR merge process as builds and tests must complete
- Requires maintenance of workflow configuration files
- May block urgent fixes if CI pipeline fails due to unrelated issues
- Increases repository resource usage with automated builds and tests

### Summary

**Core Approach:**
- Balanced functionality, usability, and performance to meet project requirements

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Accepted necessary complexity (responsiveness, caching) to enhance user experience

**Long-term Planning:**
- Evaluated trade-offs carefully to ensure maintainability and scalability
